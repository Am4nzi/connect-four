# Connect Four

Based on the [physical version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) of the same name, Connect Four is a two-player connection-game in which players take terns to drop discs into a 7 column/6 row board. The first player to get four of their discs lined up either horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins.

I complete this project during my time at Spiced Academy [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/), a coding bootcamp in Berlin, where I studied Full Stack Web Development from July to September 2019.
